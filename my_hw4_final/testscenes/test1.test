# Test Scene 1 
# A simple quad viewed from different camera positions

#size 160 120
size 640 480

# Specify the output file
output out.ppm

# Now specify the camera.  This is what you should implement.
# This file has 4 camera positions.  Render your scene for all 4.

# Again, for initial testing, maybe you want to implement a dummy 
# ray-plane intersection routine, instead of reading this fully.
# Though it's probably simpler you just implement this, for later
